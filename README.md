hydropathy_test1.R file is a test file to plot the graphs. 
Next up we are trying to make a graph by taking the average hydropathy values of 10 AA residues. this will make it easy for the end user to pin point the hydrophobic regions.

Once we are successfull wil the second phase we will move to third step wehrein we will ask the user to enter their choicew of range and the program will return that as a grph of each individual AA residue in that graph.
The final phase will be to integrate it into a shiny web app and the Add it in Into proteinVision suite.
